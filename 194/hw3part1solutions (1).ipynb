      "One of the most common uses of data is to predict what users want.  Predicting what users want allows websites to make more money by displaying more relevant ads, allows advertisers to make more money by targeting interested users, and allows online stores to make more money by recommending products to users.  While you may not like the idea of advertisers and stores figuring out what you want to make more money, it can also be useful to you as a consumer.  Sometimes those recommended products on Amazon or recommended movies on Netflix are actually things that you want!\n",

      "a) As mentioned above, for this part of the assignment, you'll run Spark locally rather than on a cluster, for easier debugging.  Begin by downloading Spark from [this link](http://people.apache.org/~tdas/spark-0.9.1-rc3/spark-0.9.1-bin-cdh4.tgz).  Unzip and untar the file so you have a `spark-0.9.1-bin-cdh4` folder; this folder contains all of the code needed to run Spark.  We need to do a little bit of setup to tell iPython how to find Spark (we set this up for you on the cluster machines, but you need to do it yourself when running in your own VM).  Fill in the path to the `spark` folder you just downloaded in the code below, and then execute it to create a `SparkContext` to use to run jobs."

There's no Master UI running here (the UI we saw at port 8080 during the lab) because Spark doesn't use a master when you run in local mode.\n",

      "## Frequently Asked Questions <a name=\"FAQ\"></a>\n",
      "\n",
      "### How do I get to the UI?\n",
      "\n",
      "The UI for the Spark master is on port 8080, and the hostname is stored as part of the `CLUSTER_URL` variable pre-loaded into this notebook.  From the master UI, you can find the link to your application's UI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What are all of the operations I can do on a Spark dataset (RDD)?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you click the \"RDD\" link on [this Page](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/api/pyspark/index.html), it lists all of the operations you can do on a Spark RDD.  Spark also has a Scala API (Scala is a programming language similar to Java); the [documentation for the Scala functions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/scala-programming-guide.html) is sometimes more helpful, and the Python functions work in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How do I use matplotlib?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of good examples on the [matplotlib website](http://matplotlib.org/index.html).  For example, [this page](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/simple_plot.html) shows how to plot a single line.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why am I getting an OutOfMemoryError?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get an error that looks like: `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted: Exception while deserializing and fetching task: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it probably means that you've tried to collect too much data on the machine where Python is running.  This is likely to happen if you do `collect()` on a large dataset.  The best way to remedy this problem is to restart your iPython notebook (go to the main server, at port 8888 of the machine you were assigned, click \"Shutdown\" on your notebook, and then open it again) and don't do `collect()` on a large dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious why you're getting a Java error when your program is written in Python?  Spark is mostly written in Java (and Scala, a language built on top of Java).  We're using `pyspark` here, which uses a translation layer to translate between Python and Java.  Your Python `SparkContext` object is backed by a Java `SparkContext` object; all operations you run on Spark datasets are passsed through this Java object.  So, if you try to collect a result that's too large, the Java Virtual Machine that's running the Java `SparkContext` runs out of memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python / Spark is giving me a crazy weird error!\n",
      "\n",
      "Spark is mostly written in Scala and Java, and the Python version of the code (\"pyspark\") hooks into the Java implementation in a way that can make error messages very difficult to understand.  If you get a hard-to-understand error when you run a Spark operation, we recommend first narrowing down the error so that you know exactly which operation caused the error.  For example, if `rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: x[1])` fails with an error, separate the `groupByKey()` and `map()` calls onto separate lines so you know which one is causing the error.  Next, double check the function signature to make sure you're passing the right arguments.  Pyspark can fail with a weird error if a RDD operation is given the wrong number or type of arguments.  If you're still stumped, try using `take(10)` to print out the first 10 entries in the dataset you're calling the RDD operation on.  Make sure the function you're calling and the arguments you're passing in make sense given the format of the input dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### I ran some code and nothing happened!\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you sure?  Some of the Spark operations will take a minute or so to run; look at the top of the iPython notebook to see if it says \"Kernel busy\".  If so, it's busy running your code.  Go checkout the Spark UI to see more about what's going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "### My code is taking forever to run.  Did I do something wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably.  In our solution code, none of the Spark jobs take more than a minute to run.  If you ran something and it's taking forever, double check that you passed in the datasets you inteded to.  If all else failed, create a small sample dataset and try your code on that to make sure things are working.\n",

      "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`Exception AttributeError: \"'SparkContext' object has no attribute '_jsc'\"`\".\n",
      "\n",
      "When you try to create a `SparkContext`, you may get an error that ends with a red box with text that looks like: `Exception AttributeError: \"'SparkContext' object has no attribute '_jsc'\" in <bound method SparkContext.__del__ of <pyspark.context.SparkContext object at 0x10c876890>> ignored`.  This is a benign error that happens when the Spark Context tries to shut down,  but it signals that there was an error when creating the SparkContext.  Look at the error messages above this one to see what the real problem is.\n",

      "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`ImportError: No module named pyspark`\"\n",

      "#### I'm getting an error that says \"`ValueError: Cannot run multiple SparkContexts at once`\"\n",
      "\n",
